# 20-20-20 Rule Eye Care App - Complete Beginner's Guide

Welcome! This guide will help you create an app that reminds you to rest your eyes every 20 minutes using the 20-20-20 rule.

## What is the 20-20-20 Rule?
Every 20 minutes, look at something 20 feet away for 20 seconds to reduce eye strain from screens.

## Step 1: Install Python

First, let's check if Python is already installed and install it if needed:

1. **Open Terminal** (press `Ctrl + Alt + T`)
2. **Check if Python is installed** by typing:
   ```bash
   python3 --version
   ```
3. **If you see a version number** (like Python 3.8.10), great! Python is installed.
4. **If you get "command not found"**, install Python:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
   ```

## Step 2: Install VS Code (if not already installed)

1. **Download VS Code**:
   ```bash
   sudo snap install --classic code
   ```
   OR visit: https://code.visualstudio.com/download and download the .deb file

2. **Open VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code
   ```

## Step 3: Install VS Code Extensions

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Click the Extensions icon** (squares icon on the left sidebar)
3. **Search for and install**:
   - "Python" (by Microsoft)
   - "Python Debugger" (by Microsoft)

## Step 4: Set Up Your Project

1. **Create a new folder** for your app:
   ```bash
   mkdir ~/eye-care-app
   cd ~/eye-care-app
   ```

2. **Open this folder in VS Code**:
   ```bash
   code .
   ```

## Step 5: Install Required Libraries

1. **In VS Code, open Terminal** (Terminal â†’ New Terminal)
2. **Install the notification library**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install plyer
   ```

## Step 6: The Code (Already Created for You!)

The main app file `eye_care_app.py` is already in your project. Here's what each part does:

### Key Parts Explained:

1. **Import libraries**: We bring in tools for timers, notifications, and threading
2. **Timer function**: Counts down 20 minutes (1200 seconds)
3. **Notification function**: Shows the eye rest reminder for 20 seconds
4. **Main loop**: Repeats the cycle forever

## Step 7: Test Your App

1. **In VS Code Terminal, run**:
   ```bash
   python3 eye_care_app.py
   ```

2. **What should happen**:
   - You'll see "20-20-20 Eye Care App started!"
   - After 20 minutes, a notification will appear
   - The notification stays for 20 seconds
   - The cycle repeats

3. **To stop the app**: Press `Ctrl + C` in the terminal

## Step 8: Make it Start Automatically

### Option 1: Using Startup Applications (Easiest)

1. **Open "Startup Applications"**:
   - Press `Super` key (Windows key) and search "Startup"
   - Or run: `gnome-session-properties`

2. **Click "Add"**
3. **Fill in**:
   - **Name**: Eye Care App
   - **Command**: `/usr/bin/python3 /home/$(whoami)/eye-care-app/eye_care_app.py`
   - **Comment**: 20-20-20 rule reminder

4. **Click "Add"** and close

### Option 2: Using systemd (Advanced)

If Option 1 doesn't work, we can create a system service. Let me know if you need help with this.

## Step 9: Customize Your App

You can easily change the timing by editing these numbers in `eye_care_app.py`:

- **Change timer length**: Modify `WORK_TIME = 20 * 60` (currently 20 minutes)
- **Change notification time**: Modify `REST_TIME = 20` (currently 20 seconds)
- **Change message**: Edit the text in `show_notification()`

## Troubleshooting

### If notifications don't appear:
```bash
sudo apt install libnotify-bin
```

### If you get permission errors:
```bash
sudo chmod +x eye_care_app.py
```

### If Python3 isn't found:
Make sure Python 3 is installed and try using `python` instead of `python3`

## How to Stop the App

- **If running in terminal**: Press `Ctrl + C`
- **If running automatically**: 
  1. Open System Monitor (`gnome-system-monitor`)
  2. Find "python3" process running "eye_care_app.py"
  3. Click "End Process"

## Next Steps

Once everything is working:
1. The app will start automatically when you log in
2. You'll get reminders every 20 minutes
3. Just follow the notification's advice: look 20 feet away for 20 seconds!

## Need Help?

If something isn't working:
1. Check that Python 3 is installed
2. Make sure you're in the right folder
3. Verify the notification library is installed
4. Check that the file permissions are correct
